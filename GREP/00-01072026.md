Here’s a **practical, no-fluff guide to `grep` basics**—the stuff you actually use on the command line.

---

## What `grep` does
`grep` **searches text** for lines that match a pattern (string or regex).

```
grep [options] PATTERN [file...]
```

---

## 1. Basic search
Search for a word in a file:
```bash
grep "error" app.log
```

Search multiple files:
```bash
grep "error" *.log
```

---

## 2. Case sensitivity
Case-sensitive (default):
```bash
grep "Error" app.log
```

Case-insensitive:
```bash
grep -i "error" app.log
```

---

## 3. Recursive search (very common)
Search all files under a directory:
```bash
grep -r "password" .
```

Only certain file types:
```bash
grep -r "TODO" --include="*.py" .
```

Exclude files:
```bash
grep -r "key" . --exclude="*.min.js"
```

---

## 4. Line numbers & filenames
Show line numbers:
```bash
grep -n "error" app.log
```

Always show filename:
```bash
grep -H "error" app.log
```

---

## 5. Count matches
Count matching lines:
```bash
grep -c "error" app.log
```

Count across many files:
```bash
grep -r -c "error" .
```

---

## 6. Invert match (NOT)
Show lines **without** the pattern:
```bash
grep -v "debug" app.log
```

---

## 7. Match whole words
Avoid partial matches:
```bash
grep -w "cat" file.txt
```
(matches `cat`, not `concatenate`)

---

## 8. Regular expressions (regex)
Basic regex:
```bash
grep "^ERROR" app.log      # starts with ERROR
grep "failed$" app.log     # ends with failed
grep "err.*code" app.log   # err → anything → code
```

Extended regex (recommended):
```bash
grep -E "(error|fail|panic)" app.log
```

---

## 9. Fixed strings (faster, safer)
When you **don’t want regex**:
```bash
grep -F "[ERROR]" app.log
```

---

## 10. Piping with other commands
Search command output:
```bash
ps aux | grep python
```

Exclude the grep process itself:
```bash
ps aux | grep python | grep -v grep
```

---

## 11. Context lines (huge for logs)
Lines **after** a match:
```bash
grep -A 5 "ERROR" app.log
```

Lines **before** a match:
```bash
grep -B 5 "ERROR" app.log
```

Both:
```bash
grep -C 5 "ERROR" app.log
```

---

## 12. Binary & large files
Ignore binary warnings:
```bash
grep -a "string" binaryfile
```

Quiet mode (just exit code):
```bash
grep -q "error" app.log
```
```bash
echo $?   # 0 = found, 1 = not found
```

---

## 13. Common real-world patterns

Find secrets:
```bash
grep -r -i "api_key\|secret\|token" .
```

Find IP addresses:
```bash
grep -Eo '([0-9]{1,3}\.){3}[0-9]{1,3}' file.txt
```

Find TODOs:
```bash
grep -r -n "TODO\|FIXME" .
```

---

## 14. `grep` vs `ripgrep (rg)`
If performance matters:
- `grep` → everywhere, POSIX standard
- `rg` → **much faster**, ignores `.gitignore` by default

---

## Minimal cheat sheet
```bash
grep "text" file
grep -i "text" file
grep -r "text" .
grep -n "text" file
grep -v "text" file
grep -E "(a|b)" file
grep -C 3 "text" file
```

If you want, I can:
- build **log-hunting one-liners**
- show **regex power patterns**
- compare `grep`, `egrep`, `fgrep`, `rg`
- tailor examples for **security / malware / codebases**
